Description: The package consists of a set of tools for retrieving snow
    and ice albedo from optical satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat and
    Sentinel-2). The tools require the following gridded datasets: (1)
    atmospherically-corrected surface reflectance, (2) a digital elevation
    model (DEM), and (3) satellite and solar azimuth and zenith angles.
    The package includes tools for: image pre-processing (crop grids to a
    specified extent, project grids with different coordinate systems, and
    convert data from integer to floating point); convert nadir
    satellite observations to off-nadir values using view-angle
    corrections; detect and mask topographic shadows; automatic discrimination
	of snow and ice surfaces; anisotropic correction of reflected radiation
	of glacier snow and ice using empirical parameterizations of the bidirectional
	reflectance distribution function (BRDF); topographic correction; and
    narrow-to-broadband albedo conversion.
