#' Unit normal vector of a surface
#'
#' Computes a unit vector normal to each grid cell in a digital elevation model.
#'
#' @importFrom Rdpack reprompt
#'
#' @param dem matrix or SpatRaster. Digital elevation model representing terrain elevation
#'  on a regular grid.
#' @param dlx numeric. Spatial resolution along the `x` axis in meters.
#' @param dly numeric. Spatial resolution along the `y` axis in meters.
#' @param cArea logical. If `TRUE`, returns the surface area of each grid cell. The default
#'  returns the gradient.
#'
#' @details Mathematically, a vector normal to an inclined surface, which is represented by
#' a plane enclosed by four data points \insertCite{@see Fig. 1 of @corripio_2003}{SatRbedo},
#' is defined as the average of the cross products of the vectors along the sides of the grid
#' cell. By definition, the length of this vector is equal to the surface area of the grid cell.
#' This function was originally written by Javier Corripio as part of the `insol` package.
#' The function has been optimized and updated to take advantage of the infrastructure provided
#' by the `terra` package.
#'
#' @returns Returns a 3D array with the same number of rows and columns as the DEM and the three
#'  layers in the third dimension corresponding to the (x, y, z) components of the normal vectors
#'  to each of the grid cells. If cArea is `TRUE`, the result is a 2D matrix with the
#'  surface area of each grid cell.
